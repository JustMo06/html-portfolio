<h1>The Best Movies According to Mo</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>
<hr />
<h3>The Lion king</h3>
<p>A beautifull movie about friendship. I used to watch this over and over together with the neighbour.</p>
<h3>The usual suspects</h3>
<p>The plot twist at the end was unexpected and it left a great impact on me. I am now a fan of movies with plot twists.</p>
<h3>Fight club</h3>
<p>I cannot talk about Fight club. I really cannot talk about it.</p>
